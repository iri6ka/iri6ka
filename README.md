### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Irina and I am currently studing coding with [**Coder Academy**](https://coderacademy.edu.au/) Flex Track Bootcamp and planning to become a *full-stack developer* by September 2021. This is a platrofm to share my journey (*hopefully*  :sweat_smile: not too bumpy) and showcase my projects along the way.

I am a public relations and marketing specialist in the past, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions in this sphere. 

Speaking: :ru:  Russian and :uk:  English

P.S. Pretty excited to create this customised profile on GitHub :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. 

Cheers!
